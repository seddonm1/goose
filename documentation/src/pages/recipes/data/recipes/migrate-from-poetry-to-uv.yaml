  The current project uses `poetry` for Python environment and dependency management. We want to use `uv` instead.

  First, verify that the above is true. If the project is actually already using `uv`, you can stop.

  Start by running `uvx migrate-to-uv`. If you don't have `uv` installed, use `hermit install uv` to add it. If hermit isn't set up, use `hermit init` to do so.

  Once `migrate-to-uv` has run, delete any local virtualenvs (often located at ./.venv) and run `uv sync`.

  Grep for other uses of `poetry` in the project. If you can switch these commands to `uv`, do so. If not, just make a note of it.
