description: Remove typical AI artifacts from Python code
instructions: Your job is to write a remove AI artifacts from Python code
activities:
  - Remove redundant comments  
  - Fix exception handling  
  - Modernize typing  
  - Inline trivial functions  
extensions:
- type: builtin
  name: developer
  display_name: Developer
  timeout: 300
  bundled: true
prompt: |
    Look at the file: {{ file_name }}
    Apply the following fixes:
    1. Remove any comment that replicates the name of a function or describes the next statement
       but does not add anything. Like if it says # call the server and it is followed by a
       statement call_server(), that's pointless
    2. Any try.. except block where we catch bare Exception, remove that or if you can find a
       specific exception to catch and it makes sense since we can actually do something better
       catch that. But in general consider whether we need an exception like that, we don't want
       to ignore errors and quite often the caller is in a better state to do the right thing
       or even if it is a genuine error, the user can just take action
    3. Modernize the typing used (if any). Don't use List with a capital, just use list. Same for
       Dict vs dict etc. Also remove Optional and replace with |None. Use | anywhere else where
       it fits too.
    4. Inline trivial functions that are only called once, like reading text from a file.
parameters:
  - key: file_name
    input_type: file
    requirement: user_prompt
