<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>
    Choose to install Goose on CLI and/or Desktop:

    <Tabs groupId="interface">
      <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        Install Goose directly from the browser or with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
        
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>Option 1: Install via Download</h3>
        <MacDesktopInstallButtons/>

        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>

        <h3>Option 2: Install via Homebrew</h3>
        Homebrew downloads the [same app](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/b/block-goose.rb) but can take care of updates too. 
        ```bash
          brew install --cask block-goose
        ```

        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          :::note Permissions
          If you're on an Apple Mac M3 and the Goose Desktop app shows no window on launch, check and update the following:

          Ensure the `~/.config` directory has read and write access.

          Goose needs this access to create the log directory and file. Once permissions are granted, the app should load correctly. For steps on how to do this, refer to the  [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/troubleshooting.md#macos-permission-issues)

        Install Goose directly from the browser or with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>Option 1: Install via Download script</h3>
        Run the following command to install the latest version of Goose on macOS:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
        ```
        This script will fetch the latest version of Goose and set it up on your system.

        If you'd like to install without interactive configuration, disable `CONFIGURE`:

        ```sh

        <details>
        <summary>Install via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</summary>

          We recommend running the Goose CLI natively on Windows, but you can use WSL if you prefer a Linux-like environment.

          1. Open [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) as Administrator and install WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution:

          ```bash
          wsl --install
          ```

          2. If prompted, restart your computer to complete the WSL installation. Once restarted, or if WSL is already installed, launch your Ubuntu shell by running:

          ```bash
          wsl -d Ubuntu
          ```

          3. Run the Goose installation script:
          ```bash
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
          ```
          :::tip
            If you encounter any issues on download, you might need to install `bzip2` to extract the downloaded file:

            ```bash
            sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 -y
            ```
          :::

          If you'd like to install without interactive configuration, disable `CONFIGURE`:

          ```sh
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | CONFIGURE=false bash

## Set LLM Provider
Goose works with a set of [supported LLM providers][providers], and you'll need an API key to get started. When you use Goose for the first time, you'll be prompted to select a provider and enter your API key.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    Upon installing, the Provider screen will appear. Here is where you can choose your LLM Provider.

    ![Set Up a Provider UI](../assets/guides/set-up-provider-ui.png)

    Once selecting your provider, you'll be prompted to enter an API key if applicable. Do so, and click `Submit`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Upon installing, Goose will automatically enter its configuration screen. Here is where you can set up your LLM provider.

    :::tip Windows Users
    When using the native Windows CLI, choose to not store to keyring when prompted during initial configuration.
    :::

    Example:

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure
    │
    ◇ What would you like to configure?
    │ Configure Providers
    │
    ◇ Which model provider should we use?
    │ OpenAI
    │
    ◇ Provider openai requires OPENAI_API_KEY, please enter a value
    │▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪
    │
    ◇ Enter a model from that provider:
    │ gpt-4o
    │
    ◇  Welcome aboard! You're all set to start using this agent—let's achieve great things together!
    │
    └  Configuration saved successfully
  ```

  :::info Windows Users
  On initial run, you may encounter errors about keyrings when setting your API Keys. Set the needed environment variables manually, e.g.:

  **For Native Windows CLI (Git Bash/MSYS2):**
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_api_key}
  ```

  **For WSL:**
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_api_key}
  ```

  Run `goose configure` again and proceed through the prompts. When you reach the step for entering the API key, Goose will detect that the key is already set as an environment variable and display a message like:

  ```
  ● OPENAI_API_KEY is set via environment variable
  ```

  **To make the changes persist across sessions:**

  **For Native Windows CLI (Git Bash):**
  Add the goose path and export commands to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  **For WSL:**
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

## Running Goose

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        Starting a session in the Goose Desktop is straightforward. After choosing your provider, you'll see the session interface ready for use.

        Type your questions, tasks, or instructions directly into the input field, and Goose will get to work immediately.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        From your terminal, navigate to the directory you'd like to start from and run:
        ```sh
        goose session
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Shared Configuration Settings

The Goose CLI and Desktop UI share all core configurations, including LLM provider settings, model selection, and extension configurations. When you install or configure extensions in either interface, the settings are stored in a central location at `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`, making them available to both the Desktop application and CLI. This makes it convenient to switch between interfaces while maintaining consistent settings.

:::note
While core configurations are shared between interfaces, extensions have flexibility in how they store authentication credentials. Some extensions may use the shared config file while others implement their own storage methods.
::: 

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        Navigate to shared configurations through:
        1. Click `...` in the upper right corner
        2. Click `Advanced Settings`
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        Use the following command to manage shared configurations:
        ```sh
        goose configure
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
