goose schedule list

# List the 10 most recent Goose sessions created by a scheduled job
goose schedule sessions --id daily-report --limit 10

# Run a recipe immediately
goose schedule run-now --id daily-report

# Remove a scheduled job
goose schedule remove --id daily-report
```

---
### project

Start working on your last project or create a new one.

A project is a record of a working directory and recent session metadata. Note that any directory where you run `goose project` becomes a tracked project, so you might want to run the command from the directory where you want to work.

**Alias**: `p`

**Usage:**
```bash
goose project
```

The command provides three options:
1. **Resume project with session**: Continue the last session in the project
2. **Resume project with fresh session**: Start a new session in the project
3. **Start new project in current directory**: Create a new project in the current directory

:::note
Goose stores your project history in `~/.local/share/goose/projects.json`.
:::

---
### projects

Choose one of your projects to start working on.

**Alias**: `ps`

**Usage:**
```bash
goose projects
```

Example output:
```bash
┌  Goose Project Manager
│
◆  Select a project:
│  ● .../Users/svera (2025-05-21 18:42:05)
│  ○ .../Development/goose (2025-05-21 18:38:26)
│  ○ .../Documents/goose-recipes (2025-05-21q 18:29:15)
│  ○ .../Desktop/temp (2025-05-21 15:13:48)q
│  ○ .../doc_projects/shared (2025-05-21 14:32:22)
│  ○ Cancel
└
```

After selecting a project, you'll be asked to either:
- **Resume previous session**: Continue the last session in the selected project
- **Start new session**: Start a new session in the selected project

---
### web

Start a new session in Goose Web, a lightweight web-based interface launched via the CLI that mirrors the desktop app's chat experience.

Goose Web is particularly useful when:
- You want to access Goose with a graphical interface without installing the desktop app
- You need to use Goose from different devices, including mobile
- You're working in an environment where installing desktop apps isn't practical

**Usage:**
```bash
goose web
```

**Options:**
- **`-p, --port <PORT>`**: Port number to run the web server on. Default is `3000`.
- **`--host <HOST>`**: Host to bind the web server to. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
- **`--open`**: Automatically open the browser when the server starts.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and open the browser
goose web --open

# Start web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` 
goose web --port 8080

# Start web interface accessible from local network at `http://192.168.1.7:8080`
goose web --host 192.168.1.7 --port 8080
```

**Limitations:**

While the web interface provides most core features, be aware of these limitations:
- Some file system operations may require additional confirmation
- Extension management must be done through the CLI
- Certain tool interactions might need extra setup
- Configuration changes require a server restart

:::warning
Don't expose the web interface to the internet without proper security measures.
:::

:::info
Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the server.
:::

## Prompt Completion

The CLI provides a set of slash commands that can be accessed during a session. These commands support tab completion for easier use.

#### Available Commands
- `/?` or `/help` - Display this help message
- `/builtin <names>` - Add builtin extensions by name (comma-separated)
- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit the current session
- `/extension <command>` - Add a stdio extension (format: ENV1=val1 command args...)
- `/mode <n>` - Set the goose mode to use ('auto', 'approve', 'chat')
- `/plan <message>` - Create a structured plan based on the given message
- `/prompt <n> [--info] [key=value...]` - Get prompt info or execute a prompt
- `/prompts [--extension <n>]` - List all available prompts, optionally filtered by extension
- `/recipe <recipe file name>` - Generate and save a session recipe to `recipe.yaml` or the filename specified by the command parameter.
- `/summarize` - Summarize the current session to reduce context length while preserving key information
- `/t` - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes

All commands support tab completion. Press `<Tab>` after a slash (/) to cycle through available commands or to complete partial commands. 

#### Examples
```bash
# Create a plan for triaging test failures
/plan let's create a plan for triaging test failures

# List all prompts from the developer extension
/prompts --extension developer

# Switch to chat mode
/mode chat
```
