This tutorial covers how to add the [Pieces for Developers MCP Server](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started?utm_source=goose&utm_medium=collab&utm_campaign=mcp) as a Goose extension to enable interaction with your Pieces Long-Term Memory.

## Configuration

1. Download [PiecesOS](https://pieces.app/)

2. Enable [Long-Term Memory Context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-context) in PiecesOS

3. Locate your MCP Server URL
   - In PiecesOS, navigate to Settings > Model Context Protocol (MCP)
   - Copy the server URL

:::tip
The default server URL is shown below. PiecesOS may use a different port if 39300 is already in use on your system:

```
http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse
```
