## Example Usage

The YouTube Transcript extension allows you to fetch and work with transcripts from YouTube videos. You'll need the video ID from the YouTube URL you want to get the transcript for.

### Goose Prompt

```
Get me the transcript for this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Goose Output

:::note CLI
I'll help you get the transcript for that video. The video ID is "dQw4w9WgXcQ". Let me fetch the transcript for you.

Here's the transcript:

[Transcript content would appear here with timestamps and text]

I've retrieved the transcript for Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video. The transcript shows the lyrics of the song, though there are some minor transcription errors due to the automated nature of the system. The transcript includes the iconic chorus and verses of this famous 1987 song, which has become one of the most well-known internet memes, often used for "rickrolling."

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the video or its transcript?
