## Example Usage

Let's use Goose to build a test automation project from scratch! We'll use the Selenium MCP to automate filling out a web form, then have Goose generate a Selenium project with the code so that we can run these tests again when needed.


### Goose Prompt

> Use selenium to go to the heroku formy site and fill out the form page with generic data. then can you turn what you've done into an automation script for me? I would like it in Java. Also use the Page Object Model pattern.
